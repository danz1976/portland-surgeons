<p>
Our mission is to take care of patients with surgical problems in a compassionate and
understanding manner. We strive to always be open, available, and helpful to our patients, with
good communication at every step of the way. We are dedicated to maintaining strong surgical
skills and knowledge, to always be able to offer the best available treatments to our patients.
We listen to the needs of our patients to find a balanced approach to treatment that keeps each
individual patientâ€™ s needs, values, and goals in mind.
</p>

<p>
We are committed to working with a team approach.  Although your closest relationship 
will be with your primary surgeon, we all work together to be sure you are taken care of in the best, 
safest, and most efficient manner possible.  On evenings and weekends, you may hear from  or meet one of
the other members of the team.  If problems arise, and your primary surgeon is not available, rest assured
that we all take care of patients in a similar manner, and your care will not change based on who is on call. 
If you are seeing one of us, and we feel one of our partners is more specialized in your particular problem,
we will discuss this with you and possibly have you see that surgeon, to ensure you are getting the best 
possible care we can offer.  However, we will never change who is doing your operation without your knowledge
and consent.  
</p>

<p>
We practice the full range of general surgery, including, but not limited to, the surgical treatment
of the following problems:
